What I Learned Today In W3Schools PHP Course!

<?php
$txt = "Huzi7";
echo "I am $Huzi7!"
?>

I obviously learned a lot more like diiferent ways to do the same thing above, but That Takes Way Too Much Time! So the example above is better and easier!
<?php
$txt = "huzi7";
$age = 12
echo "I am " . $txt . "and I am " . $age . "!";
?>

There are some more easier ways probably that I don't know off. But I am Still learning so yes Bye Future Huzi7! Peace Out!
