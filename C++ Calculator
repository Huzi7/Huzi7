This Is my First Ever C++ Proper Program. My Other Programmes were just Hello Worlds!  This Calculator only does Addition sums.

It will ask you for number 1 and number 2, then it will add them together and output the anwser.

Here is my code.




#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int num1, num2;
    int sum;
    cout << "Enter Number 1: ";
    cin >> num1;
    cout << "Enter Number 2 ";
    cin >> num2;
    sum = num1 + num2;
    cout << sum;
    return 0;
}
