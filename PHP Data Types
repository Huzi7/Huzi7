Different Types Of PHP Data Types!

A string holds a text.  "This is a string variable"
An int holds a number between -2,147,483,648 and 2,147,483,647 without any decimal places.  "123"
A bool holds a condition like True Or False!  "True"
A float holds any number that has a deximal place in it. If you put a whole number on a float variable, then it will generate an error.  "78.983"
An array holds text like a string variable, but holds much more!  ("Python", "PHP", "HTML");
