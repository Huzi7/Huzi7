How To use The While Loop Function In PHP!

1) To start of with, we need our php tags!

<php
//Our Code Goes Here
?>

2) Next, we need to type in our variables. Our variable, is going to be called "x";

<php
$x = 5;
?>

3) Next, we need to type in our while loop's code! It is kind of like the if or if else code!

<php
$x = 5;
 while($x <= 5) {
  //Output Code Goes Here
}
?>

4) Then, we have to type in what we want to output if the condition $x is true!

<php
$x = 5;
 while($x <= 5) {
  echo "Your Number Is: $x <br>";
}
?>

5) Finaly, we have to type in one more line of code! this line of code, increases the variable $x by 1;

<php
$x = 5;
 while($x <= 5) {
  echo "Your Number Is: $x <br>";
  $X++;
}




Here is the full Code!

<php
$x = 5;
 while($x <= 5) {
  echo "Your Number Is: $x <br>";
  $X++;
}
?>

This, will output:

The Number is: 1
The Number is: 2
The Number is: 3
The Number is: 4
The Number is: 5
