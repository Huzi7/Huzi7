#include <iostream>>

int main() {
    double x = 10;
    double y = 5;
    double z = (x + 10) / (3 * y);
    std::cout << z;
    return 0;
}



output should be 1.3333333 reccuring!

Following a tutorial, and they gave me this excersise to do. They said I would know if I'm correct becuase of the anwser being 1.3 recurring.
