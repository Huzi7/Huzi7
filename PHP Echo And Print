Did You Know that you can use print to print out statements just like Echo in PHP!

<?php
print "Hi, this is printing";
echo "Hi, This is doing the same thing as print";
?>
You can also use Variables like this example below!

<?php
$x = "PHP";
$y = "AWSOME";
print "I Love $x because it's $y!"
echo "$x is one of the best programming languages in my opinion because it's $y and easy to use!";
?>
